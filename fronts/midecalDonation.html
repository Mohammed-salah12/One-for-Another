     <p>We have all been touched by disease. A father lost to cancer, or a mother to Alzheimer's. A sister scarred by breast cancer, or a friend living with heart disease. In these moments, our thoughts of helping people are increasing. We are consumed in giving comfort, trying to restore order, or grieving.

      At One For Another, we believe answers can be found in our knowledge. We are relentless in our investigation to crack those codes to understand why and how disease happens. We do it so our children and our grandchildren will not lose their father to cancer, their mother to Alzheimer’s, their friends to heart disease and other more disease  .
      
      This service allows doctors to share their medical experiences on the site so that they can reach people who cannot pay the costs of analyzes and consultations</p>
